# Medieval game

Briefly about the game. This is an economic simulator in the setting of the late Middle Ages.

I have long had a desire to create a living economic simulator in this era. And so I decided to do something with my own hands for this.

I want to make the most independent and living economic system possible with maximum replayability. In this game, the player's actions should not have a big impact on the world, but this will not make the gameplay boring. Since the main feature of the game is its independence.
